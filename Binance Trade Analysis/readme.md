Binance Trade Analysis: Approach and Findings
1. Introduction
This project analyzes 90 days of historical trading data from multiple Binance accounts to evaluate their financial performance. The objective is to compute key financial metrics, rank accounts, and derive insights into trading effectiveness.
2. Approach
2.1 Data Preprocessing
•
Loading Data: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and inspected for missing values.
•
Handling Missing Values: Accounts with missing trade history were left with NaN values.
•
Trade History Processing: The trade_history column contained dictionaries, which were flattened into individual columns. Each Port_ID was repeated for every trade record.
2.2 Feature Engineering & Metrics Calculation
We computed essential trading performance metrics for each account:
1.
ROI (Return on Investment)
o
Formula: ROI= (Σrealised_profit/ Σquantity)/100
o
Indicates the profitability percentage of each account.
2.
PnL (Profit and Loss)
o
Sum of realized profits per account.
o
Helps measure total earnings or losses over the period.
3.
Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Return)
o
Formula: Sharpe Ratio = (E(R)−Rf) / sigma (R)
o
Where E(R)= Expected return, Rf = Risk-free rate (assumed 0%), and sigma(R) = standard deviation of returns.
o
Measures the reward per unit of risk taken.
4.
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) (Risk Exposure)
o
Identifies the largest loss from peak to lowest value over time.
o
Formula: MDD= (Peak Value −Lowest Value) /Peak Value
o
Indicates risk exposure and account stability.
5.
Win Rate
o
Percentage of profitable trades out of total trades.
o
Formula: Win Rate=(Win Positions/total position)×100
6.
Total Positions & Win Positions
o
Total Positions = Count of all trades per account.
o
Win Positions = Count of trades with positive realized profit.
2.3 Ranking Algorithm
A weighted ranking system was developed:
•
ROI (40%) – Profitability is key.
•
Sharpe Ratio (20%) – Risk-adjusted return.
•
Win Rate (15%) – Consistency of wins.
•
PnL (15%) – Total earnings.
•
MDD (10%) – Lower risk is better.
Each account was scored and ranked accordingly, and the Top 20 accounts were selected.
3. Findings & Insights
3.1 General Trading Performance
•
ROI was highly skewed, with most accounts having moderate returns but a few highly profitable accounts.
•
Sharpe Ratio revealed that high ROI did not always mean lower risk.
3.2 Risk Assessment
•
Several accounts had a high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating exposure to large losses.
•
Consistently winning accounts had a lower MDD, showing they managed risk better.
3.3 Profitability Trends
•
Top-performing traders had higher win rates (above 60%).
•
Certain assets consistently resulted in losses, while others had a higher success rate.
3.4 Fee Impact on Profits
•
Higher fees negatively affected overall profitability. Accounts with lower fees had better ROI.
3.5 Asset-Specific Analysis
•
Some assets were more profitable than others (e.g., BTC/USDT had a higher win ratio).
•
Losing assets were correlated with frequent but unsuccessful trades.

5. Conclusion
This analysis provides deep insights into trading performance, ranking traders based on multiple financial metrics. Risk-adjusted performance, ROI, and win consistency played a crucial role in determining the best traders.
By optimizing position sizing, reducing fees, and improving win consistency, traders can enhance their long-term profitability.
