The World Health Organization's definition of positive mental health is indeed a good starting point, emphasizing the importance of purpose, relationships, self-respect, and mastery.\n",

The more rounded definition you mentioned, which highlights the capacity of individuals and groups to interact with one another and the environment in ways that promote subjective wellbeing, is a more comprehensive approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's also interesting to consider how people's individual interpretations of what a good life is can vary greatly. What does a good life mean to you, Suyash? What are some things that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. Depression is a common and treatable condition that affects many people. It's essential to recognize that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering the text you provided, it's clear that depression can manifest differently from normal distress, such as grief or demoralization, due to its pervasive physical symptoms like sleep and appetite disturbances. However, it's also important to note that normal human experiences, like grief, should not be medicalized.\n",

            "1. **Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional**. Talking to someone who cares about you can help you feel heard, validated, and supported.\n",
            "2. **Practice self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you comfort, relaxation, and joy, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or listening to soothing music.\n",
            "3. **Establish a daily routine**: Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, eat nutritious food, and exercise regularly. These habits can help stabilize your mood and energy levels.\n",
            "4. **Challenge negative thoughts**: When you notice pessimistic thoughts, try to reframe them in a more balanced and realistic way. For example, instead of thinking \"I'll never be happy again,\" try to think \"I'm feeling sad right now, but I've felt happy before, and I can feel happy again.\"\n",
            "5. **Consider seeking professional help**: If your depression is severe or persistent, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with personalized guidance, support, and evidence-based treatments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, depression is not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you can simply \"snap out of.\" It's a serious condition that requires patience, understanding, and support.\n",
            "\n",
            "What do you think might be the most helpful step for you to take right now? Would you like to talk more about your feelings, or is there something specific that's been on your mind lately? I'm here to listen and support you.\n",

            "Human: I might suicide today.\n",
            "Chatbot: I'm so glad you reached out to talk about how you're feeling. It takes a lot of courage to share something as difficult as this. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I care about your well-being.\n",

            "First and foremost, please know that you are not alone. Many people have felt the way you do, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's understandable to feel like things are too much to handle, but I want you to know that there is help available.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not a substitute for professional help, but I can offer you some support and guidance. If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, it's essential to reach out to someone who can provide you with immediate support. Have you considered talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional? If not, I can help you find resources in your area.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's also important to remember that suicidal thoughts are often a symptom of deeper issues, such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. These conditions can be treated, and there is hope for healing and recovery.\n",

            "You are not a burden, and you are not alone. Your life is valuable, and there are people who care about you and want to help. I'm here to listen and support you, and I want to help you find the resources you need to get through this difficult time.\n",

            "\n",
            "Firstly, I want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's essential to recognize that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. The stigma surrounding mental illness can sometimes prevent people from seeking help or talking openly about their struggles.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of stigma, as discussed by Goffman (1970), refers to the negative labels or marks that society assigns to individuals or groups, often leading to social exclusion and marginalization. In the context of mental health, stigma can be particularly damaging, as it can prevent people from seeking help or disclosing their struggles.\n",

            "Regarding the advice to quit your job, I would like to explore this further with you. What are your thoughts and feelings about this suggestion?
