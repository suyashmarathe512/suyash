## üìå Introduction

This project implements a **Fashion Products Recommendation System** using a deep learning model to find and recommend fashion items similar to a query image. It leverages the **VGG16 convolutional neural network** pretrained on ImageNet to extract meaningful features from clothing images and uses **cosine similarity** to retrieve visually alike products.

## üìö Related Work

- **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR):** Traditionally uses features like color and shape; modern approaches use CNNs.
- **Deep CNN Feature Extraction:** Models like VGG16 allow for high-level visual representation of images.
- **Fashion Recommenders:** Used by top platforms like Amazon and Myntra to enhance user personalization through visual search and recommendation.
