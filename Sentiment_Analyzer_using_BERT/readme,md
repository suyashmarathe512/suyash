## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 93% accuracy in classifying sentiments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy navigation.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Get instant feedback on movie reviews.
- **Customizable**: Adapt the model to your specific needs.

## Technologies Used

- **BERT**: The backbone of our sentiment analysis.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For model implementation.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **PyTorch**: Used for model training and inference.
- **IMDb Dataset**: For training the model.
- **Web Scraping**: To gather additional movie reviews.

## Installation

To set up the BERT Sentiment Analyzer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranayshekhar01/bert-sentiment-analyzer.git
   cd bert-sentiment-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/pranayshekhar01/bert-sentiment-analyzer/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the model.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. **Start the Streamlit Server**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Input a Movie Review**:
   Type or paste your review in the text box and click the "Analyze" button.

4. **View Results**:
   The application will display whether the review is positive or negative.

## How It Works

### Data Collection

The application uses the IMDb dataset, which contains a vast collection of movie reviews. Web scraping techniques are also employed to gather additional reviews from the IMDb website, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for training.

### Model Training

The BERT model is fine-tuned on the dataset using PyTorch. The training process involves:

- **Tokenization**: Converting text into tokens that the model can understand.
- **Training**: Adjusting model weights based on the dataset.
- **Validation**: Testing the model on unseen data to check accuracy.

### Sentiment Analysis

Once trained, the model can classify new reviews. It analyzes the input text and predicts the sentiment based on learned patterns.
